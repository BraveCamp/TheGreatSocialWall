          <h2>Bricks that Build the Social Wall</h2>
          <br>
          <p>In society, there is a wall that we have created through hatred and anger towards each other. The great social wall, is the wall that seperates us from our peers and people we think are different than us. The only way we will be able to break it down, is together as a community and as equals.</p>
